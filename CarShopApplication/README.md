# CarShop - ECSE 223 W2021 Group Project
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an application for the auto-repair shop CarShop that allows various services and
service combos to be specified and then supports the owner of the business in the appointment booking
process.
The application is accessed by three types of users: the owner who administers the shop, the five
technicians who work at the shop, and the customers.
This project will be completed in 4 iterations and a detailed report of each can be found [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2021/ecse223-group-project-07/wiki).
